Mobile Price Predictor is a Machine Learning based website that predicts the price of a Mobile Phone(In USD) based on various features like (bluetooth version , display , primary camera , secondary camera, GPU, Chipset, processor , battery , etc) . 

The dataset is highly uncleaned so the project involves following sequence :-

<1> Data Preprocessing (Data Cleaning) 
<2> EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
<3> Feature Engineering (Handling null values , Outlier Detection and Removal(using Capping technique) , One Hot Encoding , Pipelines)
<4> Model Evaluation (Linear Regression , Decision Tree Regressor, XGB Regressor . Out of these 3, Linear Regression gave the best accuracy.) 
<5> Model Selection (Linear Regression)

Linear Regression :- 

In a simple linear regression, there is one independent variable and one dependent variable. The model estimates the slope and intercept of the line of best fit, which represents the relationship between the variables. The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for each unit change in the independent variable, while the intercept represents the predicted value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero.
Linear regression shows the linear relationship between the independent(predictor) variable i.e. X-axis and the dependent(output) variable i.e. Y-axis, called linear regression.

The equation for this Best Fit Line is :- 
         Yi = β0 + β1Xi 
where Yi = Dependent variable,  β0 = constant/Intercept, β1 = Slope/Intercept, Xi = Independent variable.

In the frontend part I have used HTML , CSS and Flask to create Mobile-Phone-Price-Predictor website.
